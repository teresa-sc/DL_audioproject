# Deep Learning Project: Finetuning, understanding and pruning of large audio models

This is meant as a starting point for your project. I will share some resources here and a notebook you can use as a starting point. 

You can always cocntact me at tksc@dtu.dk for any questions. We will meet every Monday 13-15 in buildign 321, room 232 for a joint supervision meeting, please prepare a small update of what you did and plan to do next week. 

For the first two weeks you should define the scope of your project (minimum: decide on a task and dataset) and start finetuning a model. Also get familiar with the methods in the intro.ipnyb and maybe start a literature search of methods you want to apply later on (e.g. pruning, knowledge distillation, explainability). 

The motivation for this project from my side are these two of my recent papers, you can use them as an inspiration and stick to them closely in your project but you are also free to come up with your own ideas!
